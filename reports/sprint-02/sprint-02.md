* User Story Left Outstanding
    * Many aspects of the project are still not addressed yet
    * Much of the back-end and front-end require work to get them to the level required for the project to be completed
    * Scripting the project with vagrant/packer is going to take time and will need to be focused on as the project progresses
    * Security assumptions and tasks will also need to be addressed for the both the project and the user's security/privacy
    * However, there is much time to work on these tasks and complete the project by the end of the semester

## UI/UX Report

Based on the intial user/admin story, we sought out to design UI and the website based around the functionality and the aesthetics we felt would benefit the user while allowing for admin to function as well.
* Based on the inital user/admin story along with the inital wireframes, we finalized our wireframes to reflect the user functionality. These wireframes contained the different views:
    * Map
    * Notifications
    * Settings
    * Beacons
* Based on the finalized wireframes, we created polished web applications screens that progressed toward and built upon those wireframes and supported that user/admin story
    * Once that screens were completed, an interactive prototype was worked on to show how the user would be able to use the front-end web site before actually committing any code.
    * These final screens/interactive prototype can be seen at the bottom of the report in the user/admin story
* Along with this, the UI/UX role organized the previous user story into one organized document for sprint #2 based on sprint #1 feedback
* While the UI/UX role was focused on UI/UX, they also helped both the developer and junior developer with back-end development such as GPS and implementing front-end UI work such as with the Vanta.js animation

## Developer Report

Based on the intial user/admin story and the UI/UX designs and prototypes, we sought out to develop and implement the HTML, CSS, and javascript that would ultimately support our front-end website
* For this sprint, our developer was mainly focused on the front end website. We thought it to be important to develop the front-end with design aspect of our inital user/admin story and implement the functionality as based on those requirements
* The developer focused on implementing the tables and areas where data would be viewed and stored on the website. We felt like this was important to focus early on as this is what the user would see whenever they used our website
* These pages were developed in sprint #2 to provide functionality and the ability to see the data that our users would want to see
    * Map
    * Notifications
    * Settings
    * Beacons
* Along with this, the developer researched, messed around with, and decided how we would be gathering our data from our beacons
    * Currently, we are using the Fetch API to grab our data before we parse it for the information we need, however we will need to use Node.js for data input, retrival, and etc.

## IT Infrastructure Report

Based on the intial user/admin story, we needed to create and develope a back-end to support everything we wanted to do for the project
* We first received our beacons in the mail and configured and activated them for use in our project
* In the first sprint, we developed a vagrant/packer script to simulate how the back-end should look and function initially
    * With this sprint, we focused more on physical server creation to allow us to develop our back-end and see what we need to add before we put it into our vagrant/packer script
* With this in mind, our IT infastructure role got and set up a physical server that would allow us to all use and develop our back-end on
    * This machine was set-up with Linux in mind, specifically Ubuntu
* We also upgraded the machine with parts such as an SSD to improve its performance for our back-end development
* Along with this, the IT role also focused on getting the server running for all of us to use
    * We also focused on the type of data storage we would want for our back-end, which will be MySQL server
    * However, a database schema on how the data should be stored is complete

* IT Infastructure Goals
    * Set up physical server to allow for real-time use and testing of our project - Completed

## Junior Developer and Security Assumptions

Based on the intial user/admin story and the UI/UX designs and prototypes and initial front-end, we sought out to develop the flow of data to our front-end and back-end from the beacons and cloud API
* One of the first things we did is set up the endpoint for Estimote API, so that we can connect and use our beacons with cloud API
* For this sprint, our junior developer was mainly focused on the data collection and flow that we would need for us to collect the data we need
* So, the junior developer worked on being able to grab and collect and view the data that was being sent by our beacon
* This includes gathering many pieces of data, but the most important ones that we focused on was temperature and GPS coordinates as these are important pieces for our project
* We based how the data will be sent on a 5 minute interval for now as we test and develop this project but this may change in the future
* Finally, we researched how to set up and how we would set up the self-signed HTTPS certificate when we got to the point of needing it


* Junior Developer Goals
    * Set up Estimote API endpoint that corresponds with micro app and sent to developers - Completed
        * Git artifact doesn't exist due to the endpoint setup residing to a cloud platform
        * https://trello.com/c/iwbRHveN/18-set-up-estimote-api-endpoint-that-corresponds-with-micro-app-and-sent-to-developers

## User/Admin/Anonymous Story

### Product Summary
By using BLE beacons that connect via LTE, we will place them inside trucks that transport perishable items that must remain inside certain temperature ranges. We can use these beacons to track data such as temperature, acceleration of the truck, and GPS location of the truck. This comes to use for logistical tracking to know when trucks arrive and leave certain locations by using GPS and beacons when trucks arrive in range of destinations.


### User Story
