## User/Admin/Anonymous Story

### Product Summary
By using BLE beacons that connect via LTE, we will place them inside trucks that transport perishable items that must remain inside certain temperature ranges. We can use these beacons to track data such as temperature, acceleration of the truck, and GPS location of the truck. This comes to use for logistical tracking to know when trucks arrive and leave certain locations by using GPS and beacons when trucks arrive in range of destinations.
