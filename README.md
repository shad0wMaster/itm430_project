Private Repo for Class Work.
I worked with The Boys on this. Robert Wrote the Beacon Firmware and I wrote the fetch.php file to get data through an HTTPS connection.
I press the button on the beacon and a virtual machine running virtualbox but can be transitioned to hyper v and other great services.
I also removed the password to the beacons well i was saving it in a .env folder but i wanna make it more secure
