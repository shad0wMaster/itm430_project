Private Repo for Class Work.

I worked with The Boys on this. 
I wrote the fetch.php file to get data through an HTTPS connection.

I press the button on the beacon and a virtual machine running virtualbox could be brought into 20th century.
I also removed the password to the beacons well i was saving it in a .env folder but i wanna make it more secure
